# <p align = "center"> YOLO-Streamlit</p>
YOLO v3 object detection algorithm well known for speed on par with accuracy. It is a 
single trainable network unlike other Object detection algorith with two network.
<br>
This repo contain yolov3 pretrained weights and inference is done through opencv.
 <br>
Streamlit is used as an webapp to give a fancy GUI to the complex backend algorithm.
This has option to infer on images and videos, it contains a confidence slider in it too.
